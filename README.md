# ETHDenver2023 - W3Care
DAPP built on top of the Lens Protocol, and ZkBob to facilitate micro donations and community support to people suffering from homelessness.

# Motivation
Homelessness is a big issue worldwide. The worst part about it is that it can happen to anyone.

Part of the problem is that even though we have ressources in place to tackle this issue, the reality is that it is rather limited. 

Housing issues, mental health problems, drug and alchohol abuse are just some the problems plaguing people suffering from homelessness.

A map that simply shows a list of ressources available is not enough since not every homeless person has a smartphone with an active data plan.

We need to find a way that directly connects professionals or community members alike to the individual in need.

At the same time, we want to build a social network for good that will motivate and help people with the goal of preventing homelessness.

# Project Description
We will be building a social media app called W3Care using the Lens Protocol.

The main usecases of the app will be to:
- Notify the local community of a person in need & try to get the right people on the scene
- Donate to community members or organisations that you care (anonymously through zkBob or not)
- Help people in need by providing positive comments or feedback
- Ackowledge the contributions of other fellow community members or organisations by liking or commenting on their profile

On top of these features:

We will be creating a DAO called W3CareDAO that will be handing out Care NFT Badges for community members or organisations that have a good reputation.
- Owners of the Care NFT Badge will be able to vote on proposals (adding new members, donation handling, etc)
